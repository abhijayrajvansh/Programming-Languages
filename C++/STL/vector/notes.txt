adding some #define commands:
- vector <int> 

to declare and initialise size and value:

- vector<char> v1(5); 
5 size vector of data type char;

- vector <int> v2(3, 10);
3 size vector of data type int and every value has == 10;

- vector <string> v3(3, "hello");
3 size vector of sata type string and every string == "hello";

* Vector push_back(vector_name) *
to add an element in the vector;

* vecor_name.pop_back *
removes the last element from the vector, but doesn't reduces the capacity;

* vector_name.capacity() *
returns the current size of the vector;

* vecor_name.size() *
returns the number of elements present in the vector;

* vecror.clear() *
it clear all the elements from the vector

* vector_name.at(indexValue) *
returns the value of the index ;

* vecor_name.front() && vector_name.back() *
returns the first and the last element of the vector;
